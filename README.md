**Fundamental Concepts of Cryptography Assignment Two - Semester One 2019**

**Curtin University**

**Requirements:** Implement RSA in Java

Along with implementing RSA, I had to implement a lot of different mathematical algorithms, including
but not limited to Fast Modular Exponentiation, the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and the Lehmann
Primality Testing algorithm.

All of these algorithms can be found in Algorithms.java.
